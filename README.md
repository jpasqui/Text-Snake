# Text-Snake
A snake clone that plays in a terminal window, written in Python 3.

## Installation
Download snake.py, and install keyboard Python library (used for input):
```sh
py -m pip install keyboard
```

## Usage
Run snake.py in a terminal window (CMD):
```sh
py snake.py
```
Make sure your window is big enough to display the game.

Use the arrow keys to move up, down, left, or right. Hollow squares are where the snake can move, filled squares are the snake, and filled circles are the food you can eat to grow larger. Running into the edges or yourself will cause the game to end, then you can press either R to retry or Q to quit.
